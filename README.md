[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/Syndicode/attr-filters.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/Syndicode/attr-filters)

Light weight gem for filtering PORO attributes with zero dependencies.

## Description

AttrFilters brings simple DSL for adding filters to your PORO attributes.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'attr_filters'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install attr_filters

## Usage

You can add filters like that:

```ruby
class SingupForm
  include AttrFilters

  attr_accessor :email, :first_name, :last_name, :zip

  filters :email, trim: true, downcase: true
  filters :first_name, :last_name, trim: true, letters_only: true
  filters :zip, trim: true, numbers_only: true
end
```

And call `#filter!` method to apply filters for attributes values


```ruby
form = SingupForm.new

form.email      = "  mike.dou@example.com "
form.first_name = "Mike 123"
form.last_name  = " Dou"
form.zip        = "abc12345"

form.filter!

form.email        # => "mike.dou@example.com"
form.first_name   # => "Mike"
form.last_name    # => "Dou"
form.zip          # => "12345"
```
